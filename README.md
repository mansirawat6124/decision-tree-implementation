his Python program implements a Decision Tree Classifier using the Iris dataset from scikit-learn. It first loads the dataset and splits it into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split(). A Decision Tree model is then created with the Gini impurity criterion and a maximum depth of 3 to prevent overfitting. The model is trained on the training data and then used to predict the labels for the test set. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using accuracy_score() and displayed as output. Finally, the decision tree is visualized using plot_tree(), allowing us to see how the model makes classification decisions. This project provides a simple and effective introduction to machine learning classification using Decision Trees.
